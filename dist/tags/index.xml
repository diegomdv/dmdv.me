      <description>The word comes from the Latin /unus/, one and /forma/, form.-
In schools it was used as a way to create identity and cohesion and also to convey equality to the students regardless of their economic background, but not anymore. Now they got modernized, going away from blazers and ties, but schools use it as a marketing tool.-
On the service industry, where you go to get an “experience”, you expect to be able to easily identify who is your ”servant”.</description>

      <description>I grew up thinking everything good happens to someone else but me. I grew up thinking that if you were financially successful you have some dirty business going on. But I also grew up thinking the only way to reach your dreams was to work hard, and as my mom used to say: _“querer es poder”. A phrase that has many meanings, some of which are “if you really want it, you’ll have it” and/or “if you really want it you have power”.</description>
