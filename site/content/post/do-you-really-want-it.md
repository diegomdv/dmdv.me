I grew up thinking everything good happens to someone else but me. I grew up thinking that if you were financially successful you have some dirty business going on. But I also grew up thinking the only way to reach your dreams was to work hard, and as my mom used to say: _“querer es poder”. A phrase that has many meanings, some of which are “if you really want it, you’ll have it” and/or “if you really want it you have power”.-

I had my ups and downs in life, and my lowest financial and self confidence point was when my first daughter was born. At that time, life was about having enough money for diapers and baby milk, and pasta or rice for us. I didn’t have a job and we were mostly living from my wife’s job and her 2nd job of making and selling home made “empanadas”.-

That moment taught me a few things. First, it made me realize the amazing kind of person I have as my wife. Second, and that took a while to sink in, that I can overcome depression not by a magical recipe, but by “really wanting it” and making a constant effort one step at a time.-

From that day on, those lowest points in my life became my strongest motivation to never go back there, to always go the extra mile to reach my goals, to work hard and work smart, to always want to grow and be better in all aspects of life.-

Now, I have a deep believe that I can achieve anything I want, that if _I really want something, I can have it_… I just need to work hard for it.-
