# Hotel eCommerce teams are lazy! But don’t blame them
If there is something consistent in every hotel I work with is how much time the eCommerce team devotes to OTAs compared to its own channels.-

I tell them they are lazy, which makes them hate me... for a little while... but it also makes them think when I expose why I say that.-

OTAs have the advantage of having a lot of resources and big teams of people working on getting traffic to their websites ([I know first hand](httsp://dmdv.me/)). So when the hotel needs to generate reservations, it’s a lot easier to go to them than to build and work yourself on making direct bookings on the hotel’s own channels.-

So I spend a lot of time working with them to bend their mind set.-

It’s very rare to see a hotel with a healthy 25% of their occupancy consistently coming from direct channels, and that translates to a big loss of income.-

```
On average, a direct booking generates 2.5 times more bottom line income than a booking coming from an OTA or an agency.
```

But, as much as it bugs me, that is something usually not known or discussed between commercial and financial managers, let alone by the top leadership.-

So what do eCommerce teams focus on?
They focus on generating the occupancy budgeted with the least possible effort, hence, lazy. But their laziness comes from the top of the pyramid, whether her name is CEO, COO, CCO, CSO, CMO or General Manager.-

```
99% of the hotels don’t have an incentive related to direct sales.-
```

A hotel head that ignores the rules and costs of online sales and the importance of building a relationship between it’s customers and the hotel in the digital era needs serious training if it want’s to do a good job.-

Nowadays, if eCommerce is not a priority, the hotel is probably going to fail.-
I always encourage hoteliers to have a top level position devoted 100% to eCommerce.-

Is your hotel prioritizing your direct channels or is it working for OTAs?
