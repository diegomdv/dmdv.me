I grew up around money being the source of all problems.-

My dad used to work as a salesman for auto parts, and he was out of home all day. When he came back home, he started doing his invoices, sales papers, orders, deposit notes and counting money from his clients payments. But all that money wasn’t his.-

!!!! Fun note: I learned how to count piles of money notes fast and easy with just a twist of my fingers.-

On some of those nights, I remember my dad thinking out loud phrases like “how am I going to pay the provider tomorrow.” or “Ohh!! The bank will charge me -this or that- tomorrow.”.-

Mom was always at home. She cleaned up, helped us with homework, cooked, washed, etc. All the typical mom stuff of that time. But when dad came home at night, there was always some argue about not having enough money or having to pay this and that and that being a problem.-

All those memories start around 1987 and kept the same for the next 10 years.-

Around 2012, when I started consolidating my financial success, I realized what changed in me to allow that to happen, my relationship with money changed. I started thinking about money as a tool and not as the center of my life. And one day I had the epiphany that made all make sense, I was afraid of money.-

From that day on, money became a mean to and end, and not the goal.-

If you allow me to leave you some thought, it is that money will always come as a consequence of what you do and the hard work you put to your professional endeavors.-
