# Uniforms create hate
The word comes from the Latin /unus/, one and /forma/, form.-

In schools it was used as a way to create identity and cohesion and also to convey equality to the students regardless of their economic background, but not anymore.
Now they got modernized, going away from blazers and ties, but schools use it as a *marketing tool*.-

On the service industry, where you go to get an *“experience”*, you expect to be able to easily identify who is your *”servant”*.-

On some other businesses, it also represents *status*, as usually each level of the operational staff have different uniforms to easily know *who is above and who is below*. Both employees and customers can see the difference.-

On other cases, like consulting or expert firms, or from managers to executives, the brand or quality of the “uniform” is used to convey *authority*, *power* or *knowledge*.-

The military world clearly shows all it’s applications, status, power, knowledge authority, affiliation, etc. That’s why there is a chain of command and whoever is lower in rank, has to obey without questioning.- 

On all the cases, they *create separation* and/or *segregation*. In my opinion not even schools should use them as they only make kids set their piers from other schools apart from them.-

We live in a world filled with judgement to stereotypes. On our minds, we put each person in a specific group and we associate all it’s characteristics to them.-

*The more we try to create identity with body image, the more we create segregation and hate*.-
